The honeybee life cycle begins as a tiny egg laid by the queen bee.
After hatching, it goes through the larva stage,
where worker bees care for it. Inside a cocoon, the bee transforms into a pupa and
emerges as an adult after approximately 21 days.
Depending on its role, it can become a worker bee, drone,
or queen bee, each with varying lifespans.
Queens mate with drones to fertilize eggs, ensuring the colony's continuity.

The salmon's life cycle begins as adult salmon
lay eggs in freshwater rivers. These eggs hatch
into alevins and then develop into fry, where they
learn to swim and feed. As they mature, young salmon,
known as smolts, transition to saltwater, growing 
as adults in the ocean. Eventually, they make a 
journey back to their natal rivers for spawning
completing the cycle.
